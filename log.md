Run, don't walk. We need to get you caught up with some fundamentals. I'm assigning
you some introductory python lessons, using Kaggle Learn's free courses.

Up front, we'll also review the final exam from infosec management from last semester.

Next in line, you need to crash-course learn the fundamentals of machine learning.
First priority is that you nail the _concepts_, and second is that you get hands-on
experience with those concepts using python libraries. We'll go over these repeatedly
this semester, and you'll also have overlap in your other classes. But first,
a firehose. Learning through repetition. Starting probably the second week, I'll have
reading assignments and mini-open-note-and-repeatable exams be due.

I'll also give you an assignment to help you start building an analytics portfolio.
Basic web presence kind of stuff. Probably also second week. Also a job market assignment to
make sure you're on track.

Over the semester, we'll do several mini projects with security-related datasets.
I'll give you some colab-hosted jupyter notebooks. They'll have named, emtpy (gutted)
functions, which below them will show output from when the functions were run before
they were gutted. You'll be tasked with filling in the functions to replicate the output.
Fun, eh? [Chris Vargo](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/people/advertising-public-relations-and-media-design/chris-vargo),
teaching in the marketing track, gave me that idea, bless his heart.

In general, I'll give you a lot of work at a fast pace, at least in the beginning. You'll also have other
classes competing for your attention. As with last semester, if you need extra time
for mental health, lmk and we'll work something out. But naturally, I think my content
will be the most useful for your sakes. If you have to choose, I'd vote that you focus
on my stuff over the other stuff. But of course I would vote that! Consider me your personal
trainer. I'll push you, but if you're literally going to die, pls don't die. Recover, then
keep going! In a non-dying way! And did you know that ["literally" can mean "figuratively"?](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/misuse-of-literally)

Woo! See you on slack. We'll all need its community-togetherness to survive this last semester.
