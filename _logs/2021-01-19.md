Okay, so you don't have to _run_ if you don't want to. You can just power-walk. I'll
try make content _available_ fast enough for those who want to go crazy, but I'll have
duedates be more reasonable.

### Last-semester infosec content
We didn't spend classtime going over the infosec exam today, because I decided that it would
be mind-numbing to do that. We may still do that later this semester, and I may still
require that you be able to pass that exam by the end of this semester, stay tuned.

Also, remind me that I still need to give you a shot at the malware lab.

### Content covered

* Goal of this class is deep conceptual mastery, wide tech mastery. See [T-based Persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills)
* Job search starts now!
  - I have been collecting [job search tips from past students](https://classes.daveeargle.com/security-analytics-assignments/labs/lab-job-market.html).
  - If you don't already one, start the creation of an online portfolio. We looked at
    having each portfolio piece be a separate github repository. Then we looked at creating
    a central portfolio landing page using GitHub Pages. Formally assigned [a "GitHub Pages"
    lab](https://classes.daveeargle.com/security-analytics-assignments/labs/lab-github-and-github-pages.html).
  - I'll prepare some resume guidelines soon, too.
  - Portfolio pieces should be some magical combination of manager-interpretable descriptions of analytics, presentation of code, output from code, and discussion of code results. For exactly this purpose exists Jupyter Notebooks!
    - You should go through past semesters' projects, and jupyter-ify them.
      - Say what you're going to do
      - Do it (code, and meaningful code output)
      - Discus what you did.
* Discussed the difference between "statistics" and "machine learning." See [my blog post](https://daveeargle.com/2020/02/11/notes-on-ml-evaluation/) for a summary.
* Emphasized the two stages of life of a model -- training, and use.
  - Machine learning != aritficial intelligence (AI). AI does the two stages iteratively --
    observes whether predictions were correct, then re-trains its internal models. ML
    does no such thing on its own -- it's deploy-and-done, unless an analyst comes
    along later and refits a new model.
  - Emphasizing the two stages, in the Facebook - Cambridge Analytica (CA) scandall,
    CA pinky-promises that they deleted all of the personal information that they
    used to train their models. But that's no cost to them, because the models, once
    trained, don't need the data anymore! The models are statistical machines grown
    from the fodder of input data.
      - Remember my conversation with my seven-year-old son this morning. He thought
        he knew enough about math, and so didn't need to go to school anymore. Said
        I to him:

        > Son, I teach my students how to make _machines_ with math.

        Don't make me a liar. Fit some models, and then use those models for ML!

* I made a feeble attempt to lift the hood on how models make predictions. I tried to think
  of a security domain example with a continuous dependent variable as opposed to a categorical one, but I couldn't think of one. Next class, I'll try again with a categorical
  example, discussing probability predictions. I'll try to bring you through model evaluation
  (confusion matrices).

  Update 1-20-2020: Here are two figures that illustrate what I was getting at with how models make predictions. Right-click > "Open image in new tab" to make it bigger.
