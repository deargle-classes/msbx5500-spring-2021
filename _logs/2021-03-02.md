My good friend [Matt Goodwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goodwinmatt/), data scientist, treated us with a guest talk / interview.
He talked about his time at the medical startup Castell in Utah, and also his time in
Broomfield in Oracle Data Cloud (ODC).

After his visit, we played with some python examples demonstrating looping in
python. We started from horrible you-should-use-a-loop-for-that code inspired
by things I've seen on [/r/programmerhumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/),
then we showed the not-python
`for (var i, i++, i < len(list))`. This led to a tangent about a recent news article
[lambasting GTA V for some cloud launch logic that was causing the boot times to take
7 minutes instead of the code-optimized 2](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/hacker-reduces-gta-online-load-times-by-over-70-percent/). Specifically, not caching a list len check,
and also, inefficient checking for duplicates. We finished with python's `for x in y`
syntax, and we also peeked at list comprehensions. A student provided a jupyter notebook

with some queries we riffed off of for live demonstration purposes.
